Many friends ask me to recommend a list for learning Visualization techniques. As I promised, it's out now!

# Best places to learn
## [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)
"D3" is short for data driven document. With d3, you can manipulate DOM with changing data and user input easily. But if you are not familiar with javascript, the learning curve would be a little steep.

*   Highly recommend [examples from Mike, author of d3](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)
*   And there is a [crazy blog post](http://techslides.com/over-1000-d3-js-examples-and-demos/) collect 1,000 d3 example. 

## [OpenProcessing](http://www.openprocessing.org/) And [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)
Processing user like to show off their work on OpenProcessing! Because it's open, you can learn other's algorithm and find out techniques to create nice effect but using the ordinary function.

## [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/)

FlowingData explores how designers, statisticians, and computer scientists are using data to understand ourselves better â€” mainly through data visualization. I learn a lot from FlowingData. Goto the [tutorial](http://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/) and you can learn enough to astonish your colleague and boss!
